Sample Pipelines:

Basic pipeline rules:

Must have the RTP payloaderwith a name of pay0 for each video feed (generally 1)

The textoverlay plugin must have the name "race" attached to it so the system can render the timestamp overlays correctly.

It also must be binned. Put () around the pipeline.


launch with:
---

build/src/camera pipeline="Your pipe line here"


*STOCK* Raspberry PI Kernel Examples:


Raspberry PI, 1280x720 @ 50fps on HD Camera Module, hardware accelerated encoding
---

"( v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw,width=1280,height=720,framerate=50/1 ! textoverlay name=race ! omxh264enc b-frames=0 ! rtph264pay name=pay0 pt=96 )"

Raspberry PI, 640x480 @ 90 fps, HD Camera Module, hardware accelerated encoding
---

"( v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw,width=640,height=480,framerate=90/1 ! textoverlay name=race ! omxh264enc b-frames=0 ! rtph264pay name=pay0 pt=96 )"

Any system, 640x480 @ 100 fps, software encoding
---
"( videotestsrc is-live=true ! video/x-raw,width=320,height=240,framerate=30/1 ! textoverlay name=race ! x264enc tune=zerolatency ! rtph264pay name=pay0 pt=96 )"


Raspberry PI Notes:

Running 720P @ 100 fps requires a change to the V4L2 Camera driver.  This change is pending.

The HD camera shows artifacts on the current kernel. This is fixed with the 5.10 kernel update.   You can experiment after doing an rpi-update.
