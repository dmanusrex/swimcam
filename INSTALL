No fancy install yet, just some notes.

In the install directory:

swimcam.sh - should install all the needed dependencies 

install_mosquitto.sh - Will build mosquitto from source. 
  There are comments in there on how to launch it properly.


build the camera:

from the swimcam directory:

mkdir build
meson configure -C build
ninja -C build

and it should compile the camera.



running it:

The general concept is "master" and "cameras"/"recorders".

The processes can all run on the same system.

You'll need a 3 terminal windows and a media player (VLC, etc)


On the master:

run SwimCamMaster.py
- this starts the network adverstisement service and master clock

The other processes can run on separate systems or on the master:

start the camera with:

build/src/camera   

You need to add the -m option if this is running on the same system as the master
That will start the RTSP server and tell you the URL.

Open the stream in your media player.


Run the starter simulator:

cd simulator
python3 simulator.py
